            <p class="font">Welcome to the very start of your React Native journey! If you're looking for environment
                setup
                instructions,
                they've moved to <u>their own section</u>. Continue reading for an introduction to the documentation,

            <p class="font">React Native is an open source framework for building Android and iOS applications using
                React and the
                app
                platform‚Äôs native capabiles. With React Native, you use JavaScript to access your platform‚Äôs APIs as
                well as
                to describe the appearance and behavior of your UI using React components: <span class="italic">bundles
                    of reusable,
                    nestable
                    code</span>. You can learn more about React in the next section. But first, let‚Äôs cover how
                components work in
                React Native.
            </p>

            <h3 class=font1>React fundamentals<span class="chapter1">Chapter 3</span></h3>
            <p class="font">React Native runs on <u>React</u>, a popular open source library for building user
                interfaces with
                JavaScript.
                To
                make the most of React Native, it helps to understand React itself. This section can get you started or
                can
                serve as a refresher course.
            </p>
            <p class="font">We‚Äôre going to cover the core concepts behind React:</p>
            <p class="font"> <span class="text3"> + components.</span> The rest of this introduction to React uses cats
                in
                its examples: friendly,
                approachable
                creatures that need names and a cafe to work in.
            </p>
            <p class="font"> <span class="text3">+ JSX.</span> React and React Native use JSX, a syntax that lets you
                write elements inside JavaScript like so: <span class="Cat">Hello, I am your cat!.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="font">The React docs have <u>a comprehensive guide to JSX</u> you can refer to learn even more.
                Because
                JSX is
                JavaScript, you can use variables inside it. Here you are declaring a <span class="Cat">name</span> for
                the cat, name, and
                embedding
                it with curly braces inside <span class="Cat">
                    < Text></Text>
                </span>
            </p>
            <p class="font"> <span class="text3">+ props.</span> Props is short for ‚Äúproperties‚Äù.</p>
            <p class="font"> <span class="text3">+ state.</span> While you can think of props as arguments you use to
                configure how components
                render, state is
                like
                a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that
                comes
                from user interaction. State gives your components memory!
            </p>
            <p class="font">
                + state. While you can think of props as arguments you use to configure how components render, state is
                like
                a component‚Äôs personal data storage. State is useful for handling data that changes over time or that

            <h4 class=font1>Handling text input<span class="chapter1">Chapter 4</span></h4>
            <p class="font">
                TextInput is a Core Component that allows the user to enter text. It has an <span
                    class="italic">onChangeText</span> prop that takes
                a
                function to be called every time the text changed, and an onSubmitEditing prop that takes a function to
                be
                called when the text is submitted.
            </p>
            <p class="font">For example, let's say that as the user types, you're translating their words into a
                different language.
                In
                this new language, every single word is written the same way: üçï. So the sentence "Hello there Bob"
                would be
                translated as "üçï üçï".
