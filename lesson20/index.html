            <p class="text">the personality section of this persona was based off the Myers Briggs personality test.
                According to the Myers Briggs, there are 16 potential user personality types.
                Our template integrates questions from this online personality test example into a series of sliding bar
                graphics. If you&#39;re confused as to what the sliders mean, check out the Myers Briggs basics article.

            <p class="text text--retreat">In the beginning, It&#39;s just about brainstorming.</p>
            <p class="text">I list out a jumble of words and draw tiny sketches related to what I&#39;m working on (and
                find the parallels later). Personally, I prefer paper with a grid so I can convey things responsively.
                Most of the time perfection isn&#39;t an issue and the sketches are just for me.</p>

            <p class="text text--retreat">I played with adding a wireframe of the website flow that would lead you in to
                each screen. For each of those screens I added a floating footer that allows users to see where they are
                in that particular flow and jump around as needed." We&#39;re digging this InVision-made wireframe.</p>
